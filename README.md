# Functional Connectivity Based Prediction of Autism Spectrum Disorder
Autism spectrum disorder is a condition related to brain development that impacts how a person perceives and socializes with others, causing problems in social interaction and communication. 
The diagnosis of ASD is typically performed using observation of behaviour as well as clinical interviews and questionnaires of the child and the parents. These techniques are crucial to identify ASD.
Machine learning and deep learning approaches offer great potential for improving the detection and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.
In this project the algorithms like CNN, ANN and SVM are used to determine the presence of ASD at an early stage.
